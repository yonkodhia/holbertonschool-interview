# **Linear search in skip list**

**Looking for a specific value in a singly linked list always leads to browse every element of the list**. A common way to **optimize the time complexity **of a search in a singly linked list is to modify the list itself by adding an “express lane” to browse it. A linked list with an express lane is called a skip list.

> " Skip lists are a probabilistic data structure that seem likely to supplant balanced trees as the implementation method of choice for many applications. Skip list algorithms have the same asymptotic expected time bounds as balanced trees and are simpler, faster and use less space. " — William Pugh, Concurrent Maintenance of Skip Lists (1989)
